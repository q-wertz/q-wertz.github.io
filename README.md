## Troubleshooting

If you have a question about using Jekyll, start a discussion on the [Jekyll Forum](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll). Other resources:

- [Ruby 101](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/)
- [Setting up a Jekyll site with GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)
- [Configuring GitHub Metadata](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#configuration) to work properly when developing locally and avoid `No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.` warnings.

## Extra packages

- Admonition support was added following [this post](https://www.adamsdesk.com/posts/admonitions-jekyll/).
  - `@import` was added to `assets/css/main.css`
  - Images were stored in `assets/images/icons` instead of `assets/img/icons`
  - Paths in `_sass/admonition.scss` was adapted to the used image paths
